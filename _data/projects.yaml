      title: "Ge3Net: Inferring Continuous Population Structure Coordinates Along the Genome"
      authors: "Rastogi, Richa and Kumar, Arvind S. and Hilmarsson, Helgi and Bustamante, Carlos D. and Montserrat, Daniel Mas and Ioannidis, Alexander G."
      abstract: "This work targets the disparities in genomic medicine that are emerging between various worldwide populations.
      We propose a deep learning architecture to infer local ancestry along the genome with simple to use coordinates.
      This could extend the benefits of such research and models to more diverse cohorts."
